The release ships with three dedicated native stacks:\\n\\n- [**openiap-apple**](https://github.com/openiap/apple) \u2014 StoreKit 2 implementation for Apple platforms\\n- [**openiap-google**](https://github.com/openiap/google) \u2014 Google Play Billing integration for Android\\n- [**openiap-gql**](https://github.com/openiap/gql) \u2014 GraphQL helpers that drive types and tooling\\n\\nFrom 14.4.0 onward, React Native IAP stays in lockstep with these modules: Apple v1.2.2, Google v1.2.6, and GQL v1.0.8. That shared version alignment gives React Native IAP stable native compatibility and a unified type system straight from the OpenIAP schema.\\n\\n## \ud83d\ude80 Highlights\\n\\n- Adopted the full OpenIAP core stack\u2014**openiap-gql**, **openiap-apple v1.2.2**, and **openiap-google v1.2.6**\u2014bringing React Native IAP into alignment with the shared ecosystem used across Flutter, React Native, and KMP.\\n- Trimmed roughly **two thirds** of our custom native bridge code by delegating logic to the OpenIAP modules.\\n- Expanded automated coverage to about **98%**, spanning purchase flows, native bridge entry points, and error mapping utilities.\\n\\n## \ud83d\udd01 OpenIAP Upgrades\\n\\n- Normalized purchase payloads on both platforms so every bridge call sanitizes platform casing and forwards the complete OpenIAP record.\\n- Migrated Android to the new RequestPurchaseProps / PurchaseResult / ErrorCode contracts, achieving parity with the Apple module.\\n- Centralized native dependency versions via [`openiap-versions.json`](https://github.com/hyochan/react-native-iap/blob/main/openiap-versions.json); Gradle now fails fast if the Google artifact version is missing and scripts/migrations read from one source of truth.\\n\\n## \ud83d\udc1e Bug Fixes\\n\\n- **fix(android)**: honor subscription offerToken ([#214](https://github.com/hyochan/react-native-iap/pull/214)) restores proper handling of `subscriptionOfferDetailsAndroid` so Google Play discounts apply reliably.\\n\\n## \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f Safer Purchases & Better Errors\\n\\n- `requestPurchase` on iOS explicitly rejects unsupported product types instead of silently treating all as in-app.\\n- Error handling now consistently routes through the shared ErrorCode table so promise rejections, platform conversions, and predicates remain aligned.\\n\\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Tooling & Workflow\\n\\n- Contributor docs clarify how to bump OpenIAP packages, regenerate types, and keep `openiap-versions.json` synchronized for Android and iOS builds.\\n\\n## \u26a0\ufe0f Important Changes\\n\\n- **Transaction identifiers**: `transactionId` is reinstated as the primary store reference (`orderId` on Android, StoreKit transaction ID on iOS). Android\'s generic `id` is no longer repurposed for orders; when Google Play omits an `orderId` (typical for consumables), `transactionId` becomes `null` and clients should rely on the unified `purchaseToken` (Android purchase token / iOS JWS). This value is the canonical receipt for server validation.\\n- **iOS request types**: purchase requests must specify either `in-app` or `subs`. Passing `all` (or any other type) throws an explicit error.\\n- **Promoted products**: events now emit the full sanitized product payload; downstream listeners should expect the entire object instead of just `productId`.\\n\\n## \ud83d\udce6 Installation\\n\\n```bash\\nnpm install react-native-iap@14.4.0\\n# or\\nyarn add react-native-iap@14.4.0\\n# or\\nbun add react-native-iap@14.4.0\\n```\\n\\n## \ud83d\udd17 References\\n\\n- Recent work: [Closed pull requests](https://github.com/hyochan/react-native-iap/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed)\\n- Release builds on the OpenIAP ecosystem: [openiap.dev](https://openiap.dev)\\n\\nEnjoy the smoother upgrade path and richer diagnostics shipped in 14.4.0!

Errors surface through the purchase error channel with `E_INIT_CONNECTION` and the hook no longer marks as connected prematurely.\\n- `NitroIap.podspec`: Depends on `openiap` `~> 1.1.8`.\\n- `android/consumer-rules.pro`: Keep rules for Nitro IAP classes; wired via `consumerProguardFiles` so downstream apps inherit them automatically.\\n- CI workflows updated to call `.yarn/releases/yarn-3.6.1.cjs` directly.\\n\\n## Upgrade Notes\\n\\nNo breaking API changes. After upgrading:\\n\\n1. Reinstall Pods for the iOS example/app\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   cd example/ios && pod install\\n   ```\\n\\n2. Regenerate Nitrogen if you edited specs\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   yarn nitrogen\\n   ```\\n\\n3.

Purchase quantity (defaults to 1)\\n- `purchaseState: PurchaseState` - Unified purchase state across platforms\\n- `isAutoRenewing: boolean` - Auto-renewal status for subscriptions\\n\\n### \ud83d\udcf1 iOS Product Types\\n\\nIntroduced `ProductTypeIOS` enum for more granular iOS product categorization:\\n\\n```typescript\\nenum ProductTypeIOS {\\n  consumable = \'consumable\',\\n  nonConsumable = \'nonConsumable\',\\n  autoRenewableSubscription = \'autoRenewableSubscription\',\\n  nonRenewingSubscription = \'nonRenewingSubscription\',\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### \ud83d\udd04 Purchase States\\n\\nNew unified `PurchaseState` enum for consistent purchase status handling:\\n\\n```typescript\\nenum PurchaseState {\\n  pending = \'pending\', // Android: waiting for payment confirmation\\n  purchased = \'purchased\', // Both: successfully purchased\\n  failed = \'failed\', // Both: purchase failed/revoked\\n  restored = \'restored\', // iOS only: restored from previous purchase\\n  deferred = \'deferred\', // iOS only: waiting for parental approval\\n  unknown = \'unknown\', // Both: unspecified state\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**Platform Notes:**\\n\\n- **iOS**: StoreKit 2 primarily uses `purchased` state for verified transactions. `restored` and `deferred` states are handled through separate flows.\\n- **Android**: Supports `pending` (awaiting payment), `purchased` (completed), and `unknown` (unspecified) states directly from the Play Billing Library.\\n\\n### \ud83d\udccb API Method Updates\\n\\n#### showManageSubscriptionsIOS()\\n\\nThe `showManageSubscriptionsIOS()` method now returns updated subscription information:\\n\\n```typescript\\n// Before: Promise<boolean>\\n// Now: Promise<NitroPurchase[]>\\nconst updatedSubscriptions = await showManageSubscriptionsIOS();\\n```\\n\\nThis allows you to get real-time subscription status updates after users modify their subscriptions.\\n\\n## Migration Guide\\n\\n### Updating Type References\\n\\nIf you\'re accessing platform-specific fields, update your code:\\n\\n```typescript\\n// Before\\nif (product.isFamilyShareable) {\\n}\\nif (product.originalPrice) {\\n}\\n\\n// After\\nif (product.isFamilyShareableIOS) {\\n}\\nif (product.originalPriceAndroid) {\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Using New Purchase States\\n\\n```typescript\\nimport {PurchaseState} from \'react-native-iap\';\\n\\nif (purchase.purchaseState === PurchaseState.purchased) {\\n  // Handle successful purchase\\n} else if (purchase.purchaseState === PurchaseState.pending) {\\n  // Handle pending purchase\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Handling showManageSubscriptionsIOS Response\\n\\n```typescript\\n// Before\\nconst success = await showManageSubscriptionsIOS();\\nif (success) {\\n  // Refresh subscriptions manually\\n}\\n\\n// After\\nconst updatedSubscriptions = await showManageSubscriptionsIOS();\\n// Use the returned subscription data directly\\nupdatedSubscriptions.forEach((sub) => {\\n  console.log(\'Updated subscription:\', sub.productId, sub.isAutoRenewing);\\n});\\n```\\n\\n## Benefits\\n\\n### \u2705 Improved Type Safety\\n\\nPlatform-specific fields are now clearly marked, reducing runtime errors from accessing wrong platform fields.\\n\\n### \u2705 Better Developer Experience\\n\\nConsistent naming conventions make the API more predictable and easier to use.\\n\\n### \u2705 Enhanced Cross-Platform Support\\n\\nCommon fields like `purchaseState` and `isAutoRenewing` provide unified interfaces across platforms.\\n\\n### \u2705 More Detailed Information\\n\\nNew enums and return types provide richer information about products and purchases.\\n\\n## Fixed\\n\\n- iOS: Fetch missing products from StoreKit when not cached\\n\\n## Upgrading\\n\\n```bash\\nnpm install react-native-iap react-native-nitro-modules\\n```\\n\\n## Community\\n\\nThank you to all contributors who helped make this release possible!\\n\\nFor questions or issues, please visit our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/hyochan/react-native-iap)."},{"id":"release-14-0-0","metadata":{"permalink":"/react-native-iap/blog/release-14-0-0","editUrl":"https://github.com/hyochan/react-native-iap/tree/main/docs/blog/2025-09-03-release-14.0.0.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-09-03-release-14.0.0.md","title":"Release 14.0.0 -
