## [14.1.0]

### Changed

- **BREAKING**: Renamed all platform-specific fields to include platform suffix for clarity
  - iOS fields now end with `IOS` (e.g., `isFamilyShareable` → `isFamilyShareableIOS`)
  - Android fields now end with `Android` (e.g., `originalPrice` → `originalPriceAndroid`)
  - **DEPRECATED**: `autoRenewingAndroid` field - use common `isAutoRenewing` field instead
- **BREAKING**: `showManageSubscriptionsIOS()` now returns `Promise<NitroPurchase[]>` instead of `Promise<boolean>`
- **BREAKING**: `validateReceipt()` method signature has changed:
  - Now takes a single `NitroReceiptValidationParams` object instead of separate parameters
  - Returns platform-specific validation result types (`NitroReceiptValidationResultIOS` or `NitroReceiptValidationResultAndroid`)
  - Example: `validateReceipt({ sku, androidOptions: {...} })`
- Added common purchase fields: `quantity`, `purchaseState`, `isAutoRenewing` for cross-platform consistency

### Added

- New `ProductTypeIOS` enum for detailed iOS product categorization

- `typeIOS` field for iOS-specific product type information

### Improved
