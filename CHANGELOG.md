# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [14.2.1]

### Changed

- iOS: Upgrade OpenIAP to `~> 1.1.9` (StoreKit 2 stability and error model improvements)
- iOS: Purchase flow is event‑only; add de‑duplication for error events to avoid double popups
- Examples: Guard `finishTransaction` until connected and add short delayed retry
- Examples: Normalize cancel handling with a single cancel popup

### Fixed

- iOS: Ensure synchronous errors during `requestPurchase` still surface via purchase error event (with lightweight de‑dup)
- iOS: Include original error message in receipt failures for better diagnostics

## [14.2.0]

### Changed

- iOS: Make `initConnection()` idempotent and non‑blocking; propagate failures via `E_INIT_CONNECTION`
- iOS: Bump OpenIAP to `~> 1.1.8`
- Android: Ship consumer R8 keep rules for Nitro classes
- CI: Use vendored Yarn to avoid Corepack issues
- Examples: Stabilize purchase/subscription flows and tests

## [14.1.1]

### Fixed

- iOS: Fetch missing products from StoreKit when not cached in ProductStore

## [14.1.0]

### Changed

- **BREAKING**: Renamed all platform-specific fields to include platform suffix for clarity
  - iOS fields now end with `IOS` (e.g., `isFamilyShareable` → `isFamilyShareableIOS`)
  - Android fields now end with `Android` (e.g., `originalPrice` → `originalPriceAndroid`)
  - **DEPRECATED**: `autoRenewingAndroid` field - use common `isAutoRenewing` field instead
- **BREAKING**: `showManageSubscriptionsIOS()` now returns `Promise<NitroPurchase[]>` instead of `Promise<boolean>`
- **BREAKING**: `validateReceipt()` method signature has changed:
  - Now takes a single `NitroReceiptValidationParams` object instead of separate parameters
  - Returns platform-specific validation result types (`NitroReceiptValidationResultIOS` or `NitroReceiptValidationResultAndroid`)
  - Example: `validateReceipt({ sku, androidOptions: {...} })`
- Added common purchase fields: `quantity`, `purchaseState`, `isAutoRenewing` for cross-platform consistency

### Added

- New `ProductTypeIOS` enum for detailed iOS product categorization
- New `PurchaseState` enum for unified purchase status handling
- `typeIOS` field for iOS-specific product type information

### Improved

- Type safety with clear platform-specific field naming
- Cross-platform consistency with common fields
- Better TypeScript intellisense and autocompletion
- iOS: `isAutoRenewing` now uses renewal info when available for more accurate status
- Android: Consistent use of `MICROS_PER_UNIT` constant for price calculations

## [14.0.1] - 2025-09-03

### Fixed

- Fixed npm publish to include required build files
- Fixed CI test execution and improved test stability
- Fixed example-expo Nitro module registration

## [14.0.0] - Previous Release
