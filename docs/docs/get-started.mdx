# Getting started

`react-native-iap` will help you access the In-App purchases capabilities of your device on `iOS`, and `Android` (Play Store and Amazon).

:::warning About This Update (v13.0.0)
**This update focuses on API compatibility with expo-iap and will be the final major release.**

- 🔄 **API Synchronization**: Maximum compatibility with expo-iap API specifications
- ⚠️ **Deprecation Notice**: react-native-iap will be deprecated in favor of expo-iap
- 🚫 **No Further Updates**: No additional feature updates or major releases are planned
- 🏗️ **Modern Features**: For TurboModules support and latest React Native features, please migrate to [expo-iap](https://github.com/hyochan/expo-iap)

**Migration is highly recommended for:**
- TurboModules support
- Better performance and stability
- Continued updates and support
- Modern React Native architecture

**New features added for compatibility with expo-iap v2.5.2:**
- iOS receipt validation methods
- Enhanced useIAP hook with callback support
- iOS 16+ transaction fields support
- Field name compatibility for expo-iap

Check out the [migration guide](/docs/migrate_to_13.0.0) for detailed information.
:::

:::note
This library will provide the basic features to consume In-App purchases on the client-side, however you'll have to implement the server-side to validate your receipts (which is probably the most time consuming part to do it correctly).

## Requirements

- `react` >= 16.13.1
- `react-native` >= 0.65.1

## Installation

Start with installing the package:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install react-native-iap
```

### `Expo`

> This package cannot be used in the "Expo Go" app because [it requires custom native code](https://docs.expo.io/workflow/customizing/).

After installing this npm package, add the [config plugin](https://docs.expo.io/guides/config-plugins/) to the [`plugins`](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/config/app/#plugins) array of your `app.json` or `app.config.js`.

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": ["react-native-iap"]
  }
}
```

#### Config plugins options

> Note: every time you change the plugins or options you'll need to rebuild (and `prebuild`) the native app as described in the ["Adding custom native code"](https://docs.expo.io/workflow/customizing/) guide.

You can optionally provide the following [config plugin options](https://docs.expo.dev/config-plugins). If no config plugin options are included, the default values from the options will be added.

##### Android payment provider

You can support `Play Store`, `Amazon AppStore` or `both`:

- `paymentProvider` (_string_): payment provider to configure: `Play Store` (default), `Amazon AppStore`, `both`

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": [
      [
        "react-native-iap",
        {
          "paymentProvider": "both"
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
}
```

### `iOS`

```bash
cd ios; pod install; cd -
```

> Note: For iOS 12.x, set project in Xcode as below:
> Build Phases -> Link Binary With Libraries -> +(Add) -> SwiftUI.framework, Optional

You can now get started hacking!

### `Android`

#### With Android Support

Go to `android/build.gradle` and modify the following lines:

```diff
buildscript {
  ext {
    ...
+   supportLibVersion = "28.0.0"
  }
}
```

#### With AndroidX

Go to `android/build.gradle` and modify the following lines:

```diff
buildscript {
  ext {
    ...
+    androidXAnnotation = "1.1.0"
+    androidXBrowser = "1.0.0"
+    minSdkVersion = 24
+    kotlinVersion = "1.8.0"
  }
  dependencies {
    ...
+   classpath "org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-gradle-plugin:$kotlinVersion"
  }
}
```

#### Configure the payment provider

You can support either `Play Store`, `Amazon` or both.

- To only support `Play Store`, go to `android/app/build.gradle`:

```diff
defaultConfig {
  ...
+ missingDimensionStrategy "store", "play"
}
```

- To support both:

```diff
android {
  ...
+ flavorDimensions "appstore"
+
+ productFlavors {
+   googlePlay {
+     dimension "appstore"
+     missingDimensionStrategy "store", "play"
+   }
+
+   amazon {
+     dimension "appstore"
+     missingDimensionStrategy "store", "amazon"
+   }
+ }
}
```

And you are now good to go!

## Manual installation

### `iOS`

1. Open up `ios/Podfile`
2. Add `pod 'RNIap', :path => '../node_modules/react-native-iap'`
3. Run `pod install`

### `Android`

1. Open up `android/app/src/main/java/[...]/MainApplication.java`
2. Add `import com.dooboolab.rniap.RNIapPackage;` at the top of the file.
3. Add `new RNIapPackage()` to the list returned by the `getPackages()` method

4. Append the following lines to `android/settings.gradle`:

```diff
+ include ':react-native-iap'
+ project(':react-native-iap').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, '../node_modules/react-native-iap/android')
```

5. Insert the following lines inside the dependencies block in `android/app/build.gradle`:

```diff
+ implementation project(':react-native-iap')
```

6. Finally [configure the payment provider](#configure-the-payment-provider) described above.
