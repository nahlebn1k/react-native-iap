We've just released React Native IAP 14.0.0 with important fixes for Expo plugin and npm publishing. 🛠️

<!-- truncate -->

## What's Fixed

### NPM Publishing

Fixed the npm package to properly include all required build files. The `lib/` directory and `app.plugin.js` are now correctly included when publishing to npm.

### CI and Testing

Improved test stability and added Codecov integration for better code coverage tracking. Tests now run reliably in CI environments.

### Example-Expo Setup

Resolved Nitro module registration issues in the example-expo app, making it easier to test and develop with Expo.

## Upgrading

```bash
npm install react-native-iap@14.0.0
# or
yarn add react-native-iap@14.0.0
```
