We're excited to announce React Native IAP 14.1.0 with significant type system improvements and API enhancements! 🚀

⚠️ **Note: This release contains breaking changes. Please review the migration guide carefully.**

## ⚠️ Breaking Changes

### 1. Platform-Specific Field Naming

All platform-specific fields now have platform suffixes for clarity.

### 2. API Method Changes

- `showManageSubscriptionsIOS()` return type changed from `Promise<boolean>` to `Promise<NitroPurchase[]>`
- `validateReceipt()` method signature has been updated

### 3. Type System Updates

Several type definitions have been restructured for better type safety.

## What's New in v14.1.0

### 🎯 Enhanced Type System

#### Platform-Specific Field Naming Convention

All platform-specific fields now follow a consistent naming pattern with platform suffixes:

**iOS fields now end with `IOS`:**

- `isFamilyShareable` → `isFamilyShareableIOS`
- `jsonRepresentation` → `jsonRepresentationIOS`
- New: `typeIOS` for detailed iOS product types

**Android fields now end with `Android`:**

- `originalPrice` → `originalPriceAndroid`
- `introductoryPriceValue` → `introductoryPriceValueAndroid`
- `subscriptionPeriod` → `subscriptionPeriodAndroid`

This change makes it immediately clear which fields are platform-specific, improving code maintainability and reducing confusion.

### 🔄 Common Purchase Fields

Added new common fields to the `PurchaseCommon` type for better cross-platform consistency:

- `quantity: number` - Purchase quantity (defaults to 1)
- `purchaseState: PurchaseState` - Unified purchase state across platforms
- `isAutoRenewing: boolean` - Auto-renewal status for subscriptions

### 📱 iOS Product Types

Introduced `ProductTypeIOS` enum for more granular iOS product categorization:

```typescript
enum ProductTypeIOS {
  consumable = 'consumable',
  nonConsumable = 'nonConsumable',
  autoRenewableSubscription = 'autoRenewableSubscription',
  nonRenewingSubscription = 'nonRenewingSubscription',
}
```

### 🔄 Purchase States

New unified `PurchaseState` enum for consistent purchase status handling:

```typescript
enum PurchaseState {
  pending = 'pending', // Android: waiting for payment confirmation
  purchased = 'purchased', // Both: successfully purchased
  failed = 'failed', // Both: purchase failed/revoked
  restored = 'restored', // iOS only: restored from previous purchase
  deferred = 'deferred', // iOS only: waiting for parental approval
  unknown = 'unknown', // Both: unspecified state
}
```

**Platform Notes:**

- **iOS**: StoreKit 2 primarily uses `purchased` state for verified transactions. `restored` and `deferred` states are handled through separate flows.
- **Android**: Supports `pending` (awaiting payment), `purchased` (completed), and `unknown` (unspecified) states directly from the Play Billing Library.

### 📋 API Method Updates

#### showManageSubscriptionsIOS()

The `showManageSubscriptionsIOS()` method now returns updated subscription information:

```typescript
// Before: Promise<boolean>
// Now: Promise<NitroPurchase[]>
const updatedSubscriptions = await showManageSubscriptionsIOS();
```

This allows you to get real-time subscription status updates after users modify their subscriptions.

## Migration Guide

### Updating Type References

If you're accessing platform-specific fields, update your code:

```typescript
// Before
if (product.isFamilyShareable) {
}
if (product.originalPrice) {
}

// After
if (product.isFamilyShareableIOS) {
}
if (product.originalPriceAndroid) {
}
```

### Using New Purchase States

```typescript
import {PurchaseState} from 'react-native-iap';

if (purchase.purchaseState === PurchaseState.purchased) {
  // Handle successful purchase
} else if (purchase.purchaseState === PurchaseState.pending) {
  // Handle pending purchase
}
```

### Handling showManageSubscriptionsIOS Response

```typescript
// Before
const success = await showManageSubscriptionsIOS();
if (success) {
  // Refresh subscriptions manually
}

// After
const updatedSubscriptions = await showManageSubscriptionsIOS();
// Use the returned subscription data directly
updatedSubscriptions.forEach((sub) => {
  console.log('Updated subscription:', sub.productId, sub.isAutoRenewing);
});
```

## Benefits

### ✅ Improved Type Safety

Platform-specific fields are now clearly marked, reducing runtime errors from accessing wrong platform fields.

### ✅ Better Developer Experience

Consistent naming conventions make the API more predictable and easier to use.

### ✅ Enhanced Cross-Platform Support

Common fields like `purchaseState` and `isAutoRenewing` provide unified interfaces across platforms.

### ✅ More Detailed Information

New enums and return types provide richer information about products and purchases.

## Upgrading

```bash
npm install react-native-iap react-native-nitro-modules
```
